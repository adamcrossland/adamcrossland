# HI. I'm Adam Crossland
I am a software engineer and a manager of engineering teams. I care a lot about high quality software, creating great teamwork experiences and making sure that engineers have career growth and well-balanced lives.

 I lead the engineering team at [MarchingOrder.com](www.marchingorder.com), a truly great company doing truly great things.
## My repos
I have several public repos here. They are mainly Go and TypeScript codebases, as those are the languages that currently occpuy my head after I am done with work for the day.

Most of my projects are tools to assist folks with playing Tabletop Roleplaying Games over the net rather than an actual tabletop. My friends and I enjoy having weekly D&D games, but we are rarely able to be physically in the same place at the same time.

Work is almost entirely C#/.NET, HTML, JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS.
## Where to find me
You've already found me on GitHub, and I occasionally post on Twitter as [@AdamACrossland](https://twitter.com/adamacrossland). 

I have a vanity website, [crossland.dev](https://crossland.dev), where I have a badly-neglected blog as well as descriptions of my open-source projects.
