# HI. I'm Adam Crossland
I am a software engineer and a manager of engineering teams. I care a lot about high quality software, fostering great teamwork experiences and making sure that engineers have career growth opportunities and well-balanced lives.

I usually work in C#/.NET, Go, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript.

## My repos
Most of my projects are tools to assist folks with playing Tabletop Roleplaying Games over the net rather than an actual tabletop. My friends and I enjoy having weekly D&D games, but we are rarely able to be physically in the same place at the same time.

## Where to find me
You've already found me on GitHub, and I occasionally post on Twitter as [@AdamACrossland](https://twitter.com/adamacrossland). 

I have a vanity website, [crossland.dev](https://crossland.dev), where I have a badly-neglected blog as well as descriptions of my open-source projects.
